# reveal.js + pug [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hakimel/reveal.js)

This is a `depth=1` clone of [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) with some tweak to use [pug/jade](http://jade-lang.com) for templating.

⚠️ **Warning** ⚠️ this repo is most likely out of sync with the original one, and I touch it only when working on new talks. It's here as a personal reference, so use it at your own risk 😅.

## Getting Started

```
g clone --depth=1 git@github.com:mokagio/pug-reveal-template.git new-slide-deck

cd new-slide-deck

npm install

grunt serve
```
